I made this program to make it easy to add games to Steam as non-Steam games. This is to add games from launchers like Epic Games and also simply installed outside of Steam games with .exe. The program adds the game in an appropriate way and also searches the Steam database for the images automatically.

I play on PC on my TV and I enjoy the Big Picture mode, but I got tired of manually adding the free games from Epic and also games that I happen to have on my PC. I was always googling for the images to make the games look nice in the Big Picture, but this program should now do that for me.

Some of my friends found this useful, so I hope it can be of use to someone else too.
